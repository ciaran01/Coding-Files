Repository contains various coding practice and work from both university and personal projects, using Python, C and MATLAB.

UNIVERSITY:

  	CMT: MATLAB code for "Computer Modelling Techniques" module coursework to solve numerical methods iterative problems

  	Coding Revision: work from throughout "Computer Engineering" module to learn and practice coding in C
	
	Lab work: Work from "Mechatronics" module using Arduino to experiment with AD converters, Motor encoders and stepper motor algorithms

  	Project Code: MATLAB code written to numerically simulate and calculate deflections of soft robotic components, 
  	alongside programs to analyse experimental photos to calculate and plot actual deflections of components

  	Software Project: Code written for software project in "Computer Engineering" module to interface with writing robot or emulator to play tic-tac-toe.
